# zhihu-spider
A web crawler script for crawling all answers to one question on Zhihu

## Why I develop this?

I am interested in Machine Learning Systems, and I am applying Ph.D. programs on MLSys. I want to know every answer related to MLSys to [this question](https://www.zhihu.com/question/360515552) on Zhihu, but Zhihu probably doesn't provide this function, so I developed this.

All the answers are stored in a local file, and you can do all your data analysis about it.

Of course, you can take place the link of the question with the one you are interested in.
